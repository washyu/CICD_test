# CI/CD Image Optimization

## Overview
Optimize CI/CD Docker images to improve build times, reduce image size, and standardize tooling across pipelines.

## Current Pain Points
- Large Docker image sizes
- Long build times in CI/CD pipelines
- Inconsistent tool versions across projects
- Manual updates to CI/CD images
- Lack of specialized images for different build types

## Proposed Solutions
- [ ] Create base CI/CD image with essential tools
- [ ] Implement multi-stage builds for all images
- [ ] Create specialized images for different languages/frameworks
- [ ] Implement automated image updates
- [ ] Optimize caching strategies for faster builds

## Technical Requirements
- Multi-architecture support (amd64/arm64)
- Minimal image size without sacrificing functionality
- Versioned images with clear update path
- Documentation for image usage in pipelines
- Security scanning integration

## Implementation Steps
1. Audit current CI/CD image usage
2. Define core tools needed in base image
3. Create specialized images for Node.js, Python, etc.
4. Implement automated build and push workflow
5. Update Jenkinsfile templates to use new images
6. Document image usage and best practices
