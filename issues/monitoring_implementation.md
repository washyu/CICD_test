# Monitoring Implementation Plan

## Overview
Implement comprehensive monitoring solution for containerized applications to ensure reliability and performance visibility.

## Current Pain Points
- Limited visibility into container health
- No centralized logging solution
- Manual alert configuration
- Missing performance metrics
- Difficult to trace issues across services

## Proposed Solutions
- [ ] Implement Prometheus for metrics collection
- [ ] Set up Grafana for visualization
- [ ] Configure Loki for log aggregation
- [ ] Implement Alertmanager for notifications
- [ ] Add OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing

## Technical Requirements
- Kubernetes-native monitoring stack
- Low overhead on application containers
- Integration with existing CI/CD pipeline
- Customizable dashboards for different teams
- Retention policies for logs and metrics

## Implementation Steps
1. Deploy monitoring infrastructure components
2. Instrument applications with Prometheus exporters
3. Create standard dashboards for common metrics
4. Configure alerting rules and notification channels
5. Implement log aggregation and search
6. Add distributed tracing to key services
7. Document monitoring best practices
