    - LogQL query language
  - Deployment: Kubernetes StatefulSet with separate components
  - Resources:
    - CPU: 1-2 cores
    - Memory: 2-4GB
    - Storage: 100GB+ (retention dependent)

### Alerting
- **Alertmanager**
  - Purpose: Alert routing, grouping, and notification
  - Features:
    - Deduplication and grouping
    - Silencing and inhibition
    - Multiple notification channels
    - Time-based routing
  - Deployment: Kubernetes Deployment
  - Resources:
    - CPU: 0.2-0.5 cores
    - Memory: 0.5-1GB

### Tracing
- **Tempo/Jaeger**
  - Purpose: Distributed tracing
  - Features:
    - End-to-end transaction tracing
    - Service dependency visualization
    - Performance bottleneck identification
    - Sampling strategies
  - Deployment: Kubernetes Deployment with separate components
  - Resources:
    - CPU: 1-2 cores
    - Memory: 2-4GB
    - Storage: 50GB+ (retention dependent)

## Exporters and Agents

### Infrastructure Monitoring
- **Node Exporter**
  - Purpose: Host-level metrics collection
  - Metrics: CPU, memory, disk, network, etc.
  - Deployment: DaemonSet on all nodes

- **kube-state-metrics**
  - Purpose: Kubernetes object metrics
  - Metrics: Deployments, pods, services, etc.
  - Deployment: Single deployment in monitoring namespace

- **cAdvisor**
  - Purpose: Container metrics
  - Metrics: Container CPU, memory, network, etc.
  - Deployment: Built into kubelet

### Application Instrumentation
- **Prometheus Client Libraries**
  - Languages: Go, Python, Java, JavaScript, etc.
  - Integration: Direct code instrumentation
  - Deployment: Built into application containers

- **Promtail/Fluentd**
  - Purpose: Log collection and forwarding
  - Features: Label extraction, filtering, formatting
  - Deployment: DaemonSet on all nodes

- **OpenTelemetry Collector**
  - Purpose: Telemetry collection and processing
  - Features: Metrics, logs, and traces in one agent
  - Deployment: DaemonSet or sidecar

## Storage Considerations

### Prometheus
- Time-series database optimized for metrics
- High write and query throughput
- Configurable retention periods
- Consider remote storage for long-term retention

### Loki
- Index-based storage for logs
- Separate index and chunks storage
- S3/GCS/Azure Blob support for chunks
- Configurable retention and compaction

### Tempo/Jaeger
- Optimized for trace storage and retrieval
- Sampling to reduce storage requirements
- Backend options: Cassandra, Elasticsearch, object storage
- TTL-based retention

## Network Requirements

- Prometheus scrape endpoints: HTTP/HTTPS
- Alertmanager: HTTP/HTTPS for API, SMTP/Webhook for notifications
- Grafana: HTTP/HTTPS for UI and API
- Loki: HTTP/HTTPS for API, gRPC for internal communication
- Tempo/Jaeger: HTTP/HTTPS for UI, gRPC/Thrift for span collection

## Security Considerations

- TLS for all communications
- Authentication for all UIs and APIs
- RBAC for Kubernetes resources
- Network policies to restrict traffic
- Secrets management for credentials
- Regular security updates
